# V&V API Integration Status Report

This report details the current status of the V&V API integration project.

## What is Working

*   **Web Application Frontend:** A functional frontend has been created with a user-friendly interface for searching parts. You can view it by opening the `vandv-app/frontend/index.html` file in your browser.
*   **Mocked API Responses:** The frontend is connected to a mocked API, which allows you to see how the application will display both successful and failed API responses.
*   **Comprehensive Error Reporting:** The application now provides detailed error messages from the API, including the `retCode` and `retMsg`. This will be crucial for debugging the API connection.
*   **API `test-search` Page:** The provider's `test-search` page is accessible and returns valid data, which confirms that the API server is running.

## What is Not Working

*   **Direct API Communication:** All attempts to communicate directly with the `GetPartsInfo` API endpoint have failed. This includes:
    *   POST requests with credentials in the body.
    *   GET requests with credentials in the URL.
    *   Both sandbox and production credentials.
*   **API Authentication:** The consistent error message is `"retCode": "201", "retMsg": "Invalid Token or Username/Password"`. This suggests an issue with the credentials themselves or the way they are being sent.

## Next Steps and Recommendations

1.  **Contact the API Provider:** The most critical next step is to contact the V&V API provider and share the detailed error messages. Specifically, you should ask them:
    *   To confirm that the provided credentials (`M1945`/`9dVxdym69mNs3G8` and `M4800`/`testvandv1`) are correct and active.
    *   To provide a working `curl` example or code snippet for calling the `GetPartsInfo` endpoint.
    *   To clarify the exact authentication method required (e.g., headers, request body, query parameters).

2.  **Investigate the "Exploded View Diagram" Feature:** The provided documentation does not mention this feature. You should ask the API provider if this is available and how to access it. It may require a different endpoint or additional parameters.

Once the API access issue is resolved, the frontend can be quickly updated to use the live API instead of the mocked data.
